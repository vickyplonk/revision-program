Term,Answer
CPU,Central Processing Unit
CU,"Controls and coordinates the activites of the CPU, directs the flow of data between the CPU and peripherals, manages FDE cycle"
Bus,Set of parallel wires
System Bus,Address Bus + Data Bus + Control Bus
Address Bus,Unidirectional bus
Data Bus,Bidirectional Bus
Control Bus,Bidirectional Bus
Control Line,Bus Request + Bus Grant + Memory Write + Memory Read + Interrupt Request + Clock
Word,Fixed size group of digits handled as a unit by the processor
ALU,Arithmetic and Logic Unit
Register,High speed memory cells
ACC,"Short term, intermediate storage"
PC,Program Counter
MDR,Temp store data AKA memory buffer register
MAR,holds the address of the memory location from which data or an instruction is to be fetched or to which data is to be written
FDE,the basic cycle that a CPU carries out to process and execute an instruction
Opcode,Operation to be performed and hardware to be used
Operand,Address of data or actual data
Factors affecting CPU Performance,Clock Speed + Number of Cores + Amount of Cache
System Clock,Device generates signals 0-->1
Cache Memory,Fast storage medium - closer to CPU than RAM
VN Architecture,Stored program Concept + shared memory and bus + single ALU
Harvard,Separate memories for data and instructions
DSP,Digital Signal Processing Systems
Embedded Systems,Special Purpose systems built into large mechanical systems or devices
Pipelining,One instruction fetched while another decoded and another executed
VN Bottleneck,CPU has to wait + limits efficiency
Arithmetic Pipeline,Pipeline for ALU operations
Instruction Pipeline,Used for FDE
Pipeline Stall,Parts of CPU are dormant waiting for other parts to finish processing
Flush,Flush the pipeline
Hyper Threading,Pipeline bubbles filled with other instructions from different threads
